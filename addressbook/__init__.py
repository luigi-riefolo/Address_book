 Add a person to the address book.
    Add a group to the address book.
    Given a group we want to easily find its members.
    Given a person we want to easily find the groups the person belongs to.
    Find person by name (can supply either first name, last name, or both).
    Find person by email address (can supply either the exact string or a prefix string, ie. both "alexander@company.com" and "alex" should work).

Design-only questions:

    Find person by email address (can supply any substring, ie. "comp" should work assuming "alexander@company.com" is an email address in the address book) - discuss how you would implement this without coding the solution.
